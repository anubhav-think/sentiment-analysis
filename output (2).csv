4,"First of all, Toyota is one of the best selling makes in the auto industry, so people ARE buying them.    That said, I have a Toyota (Avalon hybrid) It's okay for a boring, slow, fuel efficient way to get from point A to point B, except the driver seat is horribly uncomfortable for me. No matter how I adjust the seat or the lumbar support, I actually get random back spasms from that seat that I don't get from any other car I've ever driven.   And while I don't need something absurd like an M5 that does 0-60 in 4sec or anything nuts like that, I would like a family sedan that can move when I want it to (5.5ish 0-60 is a sweet spot), has some luxury appointments and seat adjustability and has decent suspension for canyon carving.   As far as I can tell, Toyota doesn't have anything that fits those requirements. Even most of the Lexus models seem to be slow as hell, and don't generally handle the twisties as well as other makes.   If all your care about is reliability, then sure, Toyota is a great choice, but not everybody wants the same things in a vehicle.",0.17539216578006744,0.3839002847671509,0.4407075345516205
5,"Late '90s, I was driving across the Brooklyn Bridge, listening to music, and the CD skipped. I made the error of looking down for one second, and booted the people carrier in front up the rear.   Gently, but still a boot.  Got out and immediately clocked the license plates were from Boston/Massachusetts. Uh oh. My only knowledge of Boston at the time was that a lot of lawyers lived there.   The bloke got out, and I started by apologising profusely. He fussed with the bumper - a fastening must have snapped - and over the cacophony of horns, said not to worry about it.  I had nightmares for months that he would somehow track me down, but it helped that it was a driveaway that I'd collected in Seattle and was about a mile from dropping off.

7,This is just speculation I obviously can‚Äôt predict the future. Don‚Äôt take this so seriously lol  Hamlin stays 3 more years‚Ä¶FedEx decides to leave. He retires and focuses on being a team owner/podcast personality.   Truex retires after next year. He‚Äôs won his last Cup series race in my opinion and only stayed as a favor to JGR to keep Bass Pro Shops on board.   Bell runs out the rest of his contract and eventually get wooed away by another team (maybe Hendrick who will let him run dirt races). He dominates the Toyotas for a few years but then gets put on the back burner for Ty Gibbs. Toyota drops the ball. Alternative is he drives for 23XI in a Toyota demanded move.   Ty Gibbs has a good career and has double digit wins over the next 7 or so seasons. Eventually he takes the reigns over at JGR (as everyone expected) and matures and grows into a like-able driver to fans everywhere.

35,"Offroad vehicles are typically designed to go slowly over rough terrain.  Their shape does not matter for aerodynamics, and being boxy means the most storage space for any given footprint.  At the opposite end of the spectrum are sports cars and cars designed for efficiency, such as the Chevrolet Corvette and the Toyota Prius.  Those still have to have the space they need to do their jobs (space for two people plus a large engine for the former, space for people and cargo for the latter) while still being good aerodynamically.  Then, you have white vans, lorries/tractor-trailer trucks, box trucks, etc.  Those are designed for the road, but need to maximize cargo space.  The fronts tend to have as much aero design as they can get away with, and the sides often have skirts, etc.  There is a limit to how efficient the design can be, but if you can carry enough stuff in the back, the efficiency matters less.  Back to offroad vehicles, that is why they were originally boxy.  Nobody cares what shape offroad vehicles, bulldozers, or forklifts, were.  Over time though, those offroad vehicles became the luxury vehicles as well, and space inside luxury vehicles matter.  So, even while it is possible to try to make them less boxy, people have long associated ""boxy"" with ""good offroad"", which draws people to buy these box-vehicles, even when they will never take them further offroad than parking on the grass at the park.  (On a side note, this has caused people who ACTUALLY need large offroad vehicles to be able to get them used more cheaply than before, and often in better shape because these ""road queens"" never left the road.)",0.14826838672161102,0.7333731651306152,0.11835842579603195

68,"&gt;Exxon planning on starting stock buybacks before the pandemic had even begun, which only proves what I stated earlier, that (weirdly enough) oil companies are driven by profits.   Which then doesn't justify the public forgiving them for recouping losses which they caused themselves... and already recouped and are still holding prices high.   You're claiming I don't seek to be disproven but you keep attempting to only discuss half the conversation. Take this seriously if you want others to.  &gt;Would you buy your own stock in that case? No. You‚Äôd ride, slow production a little if prices dip below $30/bbl, and watch the dividends roll in.  I'd have rainy day savings given recent oil instability. Even Toyota learned that lesson.   Due to that, I would not ""need"" to sell refineries in 2020 that I would need soon, I would not demand more land when I already have 10 million acres unused I'm paying for, I would forward 2018 and 2019 profits to 2020 rather than trying to scrub that from history, and when I more than recouped 2020 losses I wouldn't need to keep $80 a barrel in fucking 2023 at the expense of the American public while lying about its causes blaming Biden even though he gave me what I wanted.

74,"&gt; The glut of hundreds of thousands of high polluting vehicles sitting in Chinese dealerships comes as Chinese consumers shift rapidly to EVs. Over 25% of all new cars sold in China in 2022 were electric. &gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; According to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM), 27 million vehicles were sold in China in 2022, with almost 7 million being EVs. China accounted for around two-thirds of global sales of EVs last year.  Maybe I'm missing something here, but if sales of ICE vehicles are ~1.5 million a month, the shift to 6b isn't due for another 2 months, and there's just a couple hundred thousand cars sitting in dealerships, what's the issue?   &gt;In the first two months of the year, sales of Japanese brands in China have dropped by 40% year-on-year. German and Korean brands have dropped by around 20% while US brands have dropped 12.5%.  This is a really weird way of lumping market losses together, and trying to drive a narrative by disregarding the market conditions.  In January the entire market was down 43% off the back of Covid outbreaks, EV incentives ending and an early Lunar New Year. Changan were down ~30%, VW down 40%, Toyota down 40% and Geely was down a whopping 50%, with BYD being a rare bright spot - so whatever they're trying to infer, they picked the most unstable month they could in an attempt to make their point.  I can't find anything about any vehicles not being 6b compliant, though, and no breakdown of how much ""healthy"" supply there would normally be in dealerships vs this ""glut"" of non-compliant vehicles - making the whole thing feel a bit drummed up.    Particularly since the implementation of 6b has been pushed back to 2024.",0.15406596660614014,0.7676612734794617,0.07827271521091461

77,"Well, for a business it's rather easy to figure out if something ""makes sense"". Does the cost lead to a sufficiently greater return vs investing that money in a savings account? If likely, then it makes sense.  But for a hobby? Nothing about a hobby makes financial sense. Would a Camera company like you to buy their expensive high end full frame products and pro lenses? Of course. It's no more misleading than Toyota hoping you buy a Lexus rather than a Camry.   OK, now to the nuance. You have to decide what's important in your hobby. You can take phone pics as you said. I don't like to, but that doesn't mean you can get good phone pics. But you pointed out all the reasons to get Full Frame - it's where the tech is going first so if you want the latest and greatest, you're looking there. Lenses are made mostly for Full Frame.   Everything else you mentioned is tradeoffs. If you shoot close up mostly, then you don't need large lenses for Full Frame, you can use a small prime like your phone does (or set of primes). You have to ask - how important is low light? Better high ISO performance? Potentially better lenses?   What I have come to think is for many enthusiasts, APSC is what doesn't make sense. You don't get the latest tech or high end build (R7 not withstanding), you don't get the best low light performance, and you don't really get smaller lenses because they usually don't make them for APSC, or if you did want to go birding, you don't want a smaller APSC 400mm, you want all the reach out of the 150-600mm...  And Full Frame usually doesn't make sense if you are imposing a budget on yourself. Full Frame is too expensive unless you go really old. You can use a 5Dmii sure, but the lenses are still expensive, and if you're good with that, you can be good with most anything too.  It seems to me that M43 or Full Frame is the choice in pro cameras.  I have shot a bunch in lower light with an 80D. It's old tech, so IDK how relevant it is today, but it was decentish in low light. No where near an R5, but that's a much newer sensor and full frame, so I'd expect that.",0.19695577025413513,0.6661624312400818,0.1368817836046219
